    - New file --> Rmarkdown doc --> From template --> GitHub document
    - Talk through the pieces:
      - YAML header
      - sections
      - code headers (code chunk name, options, link to examples: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/rmarkdown/)
      - text
    - Give it a title and knit it
    - look at output that is created by RStudio
    - examine each of the files
